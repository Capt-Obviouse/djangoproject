Assignment:

Enhance the personal website youâ€™ve created in the preceding chapters of this book to prevent security issues. To do this, review each form field in your site and identify any additional validation that you could reasonably add. In particular, look for situations where you could use a regular expression to limit the allowable characters in order to exclude characters used in creating JavaScript code. Use word-processing software to create a table like Table - 9-4, which includes an example. Add a row for each form field in your website. See page 679 in your book.
